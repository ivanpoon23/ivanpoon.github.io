                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am currently a student at Univerity of Wisconsin-Madison.
                    I am a double major in Computer Science and Data Science.
                    I am proficient in Java and Python
                    and have some experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                    I am currently learning about React and Node.js.
                    I am also familiar with SQL and R.
                    I am also interested in data science and machine learning.
                    I am familiar with different machine learning algorithms and have experience with
                    data visualization tools such as Tableau and Matplotlib.
                </p>

                <h2>Here are a list of projects I have worked on: </h2>
                <p>
                My first project was Hangman in which I simply used Java's object oriented programming and print statements 
                </p>
                <p>
                Then a few other games over this summer I figured I try getting more comefortable with Python becuase it was more simple 
                which made the coding interviews easier since there is less syntax that I would need to do. So I created tic-tac-toe.</p> 
                <p>
                I also created the game Space Invaders using JavaFX. Through this project I learned a rudimentary way of creating a UI and
                actually using image files and placing them onto the games
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then through some classes I took in college and some of my own searching I created a more data science project 
                    about the NBA. Specifically, I used scraped data off of NBA Reference (a collection of NBA stats over the years) to 
                    predict the way the teams would perform in the Playoffs.Moreover, using data from previous years to train many different models, to predict the NBA Champions. I used 
                    machine learning techniques such as linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks. 
                    I also evaluated the models using metrics like accuracy and mean squared error to determine the best-performing model.
